              I live in Kristiansand with my fianc√©, and I have just finished 2
              years as a student of <b>Front End Development</b> at Noroff
              School of Technology and Digital Media with graduation June 2024.

              I find coding to be highly engaging, and love solving the everyday
              issues that will always occur. I am particularly interested in
              creating user-friendly, responsive web applications.
            </li>
            <li>
              Learning every day, hoping to soon join the real world of
              applicable coding. I am continuously improving my skills through
              online courses and personal projects.
            </li>
            <li>
              I am available for hire and eager to contribute to innovative

              Plan to do one more year of school starting August 2024, this time{" "}
              <b>Backend Development</b>. I believe having a full-stack skill
              set will allow me to understand and tackle a wider range of
              challenges in web development.

              and tv-shows, as well as keeping up with all things tech &
              science. I also enjoy participating in tech communities and
