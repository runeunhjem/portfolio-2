        Fullstack Project Experience:
      </h3>
      <p>
        My final projects reflect my evolution into a fullstack developer. I
        have built RESTful APIs, robust authentication, secure role-based
        systems, advanced product filtering, dynamic cart/order logic, and full
        admin dashboards â€” always focusing on maintainability and user
        experience. This transition demonstrates my commitment to mastering both
        front- and back-end technologies.

        and thrive in fast-paced environments. I&apos;m open to remote work or
        on-site roles in Kristiansand, flexible with hours, and committed to
        delivering consistent, high-quality results.
