        Why choose an &quot;elder&quot;?
      </h3>
      <p>
        At 55, I bring a wealth of life experience and a fresh academic
        background to the table. I have recently completed a two-year Front-End
        development program and am now signed up for a year of Back-End
        development studies.
      </p>
      <p>Here&apos;s why my unique profile makes me a valuable asset:</p>
      <h3 style={{ fontWeight: "bold", marginTop: "1rem" }}>
        Life Experience:
      </h3>
      <p>
        Years of life experience bring maturity, responsibility, and a unique
        perspective to the workplace.
      </p>
      <h3 style={{ fontWeight: "bold", marginTop: "1rem" }}>Dedication:</h3>
      <p>
        Returning to school and completing studies at 55 demonstrates dedication
        and commitment to learning and career development.
      </p>
      <h3 style={{ fontWeight: "bold", marginTop: "1rem" }}>Work Ethic:</h3>
      <p>
        Mature professionals often have a strong work ethic, honed through
        various life and work experiences.
      </p>
      <h3 style={{ fontWeight: "bold", marginTop: "1rem" }}>
        Problem-Solving Skills:
      </h3>
      <p>
        With broader life experience, I&apos;ve developed strong problem-solving
        skills that are transferable to technical challenges.
      </p>
      <h3 style={{ fontWeight: "bold", marginTop: "1rem" }}>Adaptability:</h3>
      <p>
        Returning to school and learning new skills shows a high level of
        adaptability and willingness to embrace change.
      </p>
      <h3 style={{ fontWeight: "bold", marginTop: "1rem" }}>
        Diverse Perspectives:
      </h3>
      <p>
        My varied life experiences can bring fresh and diverse perspectives to
        the team and projects.
      </p>
      <h3 style={{ fontWeight: "bold", marginTop: "1rem" }}>
        Professionalism:
      </h3>
      <p>
        Years of interacting in various professional and personal contexts have
        led to high levels of professionalism and effective communication.
      </p>
      <h3 style={{ fontWeight: "bold", marginTop: "1rem" }}>
        Leadership Potential:
      </h3>
      <p>
        Life experience can enhance leadership abilities, making me a strong
        candidate for future leadership roles.
      </p>
      <h3 style={{ fontWeight: "bold", marginTop: "1rem" }}>
        Work-Life Balance:
      </h3>
      <p>
        At this stage in my life, I have a better understanding of work-life
        balance. While I am not a stranger to overtime, I typically cap it at 16
        hours if required to work several days in a row. This approach
        contributes to sustained productivity and job satisfaction.
        Additionally, with no children under 16 and no pregnancies expected, I
        am able to maintain a high level of focus and availability for work
        commitments.
      </p>
      <h3 style={{ fontWeight: "bold", marginTop: "1rem" }}>Mentorship:</h3>
      <p>
        Even as a fresh graduate, my life experience allows me to mentor younger
        colleagues, fostering a supportive work environment. My background
        includes being a gymnastics champion (Sørlandsmester), serving as a
        department manager for IT at Elkjøp, and raising three successful
        children – an investor, an interior designer, and my youngest, who was
        just accepted into a top chef program.
      </p>
      <h3 style={{ fontWeight: "bold", marginTop: "1rem" }}>
        Focus and Determination:
      </h3>
      <p>
        Choosing to pursue a new career at 55 shows a high level of focus and
        determination, traits valuable in any role.
      </p>
      <h3 style={{ fontWeight: "bold", marginTop: "1rem" }}>Stability:</h3>
      <p>
        I am likely to be more stable in my career choices, reducing turnover
        and providing long-term value to the company.
      </p>
      <h3 style={{ fontWeight: "bold", marginTop: "1rem" }}>
        Learning Agility:
      </h3>
      <p>
        My recent educational experience proves that I have strong learning
        agility and the ability to quickly acquire new skills. This dedication
        to learning extends beyond formal education. While not every single day,
        it is rare for me to go a day without seeking out new knowledge.
      </p>
      <h3 style={{ fontWeight: "bold", marginTop: "1rem" }}>Empathy:</h3>
      <p>
        With more life experience, I have a higher level of empathy, enhancing
        teamwork and client relations.
