        Why choose an &quot;elder&quot;?
      </h3>
      <p>
        As a child of the Summer of &apos;69, I bring a wealth of life
        experience and a fresh academic background to the table. I recently
        completed a two-year Front-End Development program and followed it with
        a one-year Back-End Development track — all finished with top grades.
      </p>
      <p>Here&apos;s why my unique profile makes me a valuable asset:</p>

      <h3 style={{ fontWeight: "bold", marginTop: "1rem" }}>
        Life Experience:
      </h3>
      <p>
        Decades of real-world experience bring maturity, responsibility, and a
        broader perspective to the workplace.
      </p>

      <h3 style={{ fontWeight: "bold", marginTop: "1rem" }}>Dedication:</h3>
      <p>
        Returning to school and completing three years of study at this stage in
        life shows serious commitment to personal growth and career development.
      </p>

      <h3 style={{ fontWeight: "bold", marginTop: "1rem" }}>Work Ethic:</h3>
      <p>
        Years of life and work have shaped a strong, dependable work ethic. I
        consistently show up, deliver, and take pride in doing things properly.
      </p>

      <h3 style={{ fontWeight: "bold", marginTop: "1rem" }}>
        Problem-Solving Skills:
      </h3>
      <p>
        Life teaches resilience. I’ve developed a grounded, solution-oriented
        mindset that translates well to technical challenges.
      </p>

      <h3 style={{ fontWeight: "bold", marginTop: "1rem" }}>Adaptability:</h3>
      <p>
        Choosing to upskill and switch careers proves I embrace change, learn
        quickly, and adapt to new technologies and environments.
      </p>

      <h3 style={{ fontWeight: "bold", marginTop: "1rem" }}>
        Diverse Perspectives:
      </h3>
      <p>
        My background brings a fresh and balanced perspective to teams —
        blending creativity, practicality, and empathy.
      </p>

      <h3 style={{ fontWeight: "bold", marginTop: "1rem" }}>
        Professionalism:
      </h3>
      <p>
        Years of experience across various industries have shaped clear,
        respectful, and effective communication styles.
      </p>

      <h3 style={{ fontWeight: "bold", marginTop: "1rem" }}>
        Leadership Potential:
      </h3>
      <p>
        From leading departments to raising a family, I’ve built strong
        leadership qualities — through both personal and professional roles.
      </p>

      <h3 style={{ fontWeight: "bold", marginTop: "1rem" }}>
        Work-Life Balance:
      </h3>
      <p>
        I understand the value of balance and boundaries. While I’m no stranger
        to overtime, I cap extended work sessions to around 16 hours if needed —
        ensuring long-term productivity. With grown-up children and no family
        distractions, I remain focused and available.
      </p>

      <h3 style={{ fontWeight: "bold", marginTop: "1rem" }}>Mentorship:</h3>
      <p>
        Even as a newly graduated developer, I offer a mentoring presence. I’ve
        coached in sports, led teams at Elkjøp, and raised three successful
        children — now an investor, an interior designer, and a top chef in
        training.
      </p>

      <h3 style={{ fontWeight: "bold", marginTop: "1rem" }}>
        Focus and Determination:
      </h3>
      <p>
        Pivoting to tech at this age requires a deep drive and razor-sharp focus
        — both of which I bring into every project.
      </p>

      <h3 style={{ fontWeight: "bold", marginTop: "1rem" }}>Stability:</h3>
      <p>
        I’m not chasing job titles — I’m looking to invest in something
        meaningful and stay the course.
      </p>

      <h3 style={{ fontWeight: "bold", marginTop: "1rem" }}>
        Learning Agility:
      </h3>
      <p>
        Whether through school, online tutorials, or documentation, I absorb and
        apply new knowledge constantly. Rarely a day goes by without learning
        something new.
      </p>

      <h3 style={{ fontWeight: "bold", marginTop: "1rem" }}>Empathy:</h3>
      <p>
        Life experience has taught me to understand others — a trait that boosts
        collaboration, teamwork, and client satisfaction.
